# Mental Health HPSAs

For a group project with classmates Chuqin Jiang and Richard Abbey for the class Reporting II: Intro to Data Journalism, this repository contains a notebook that analyzes federal data on mental health provider shortage areas. The shortage areas are federally designated by the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA). It can be accessed here:
https://data.hrsa.gov/data/download under "Shortage Areas."

Our analysis found that the growth in the population of mental health provider shortage areas, or HPSAs, was outpacing national population growth â€” meaning the shortage is only getting worse.
